# Problem set 2

**Instructions**: Answer the following questions in a Stata do-file, and submit your resulting log file via email to sean.corcoran@vanderbilt.edu, preferably as a .pdf or .txt file. Use your last name and problem set number as the filename (e.g., Walz Problem Set 2.txt).  The resulting log should include the questions below (commented), your commands, output, and written responses. Edit this file as appropriate, with any requested interpretations of your output. Graphical output can be submitted separately, preferably as a PDF file. Working together is encouraged, but all submitted work should be that of the individual student.
