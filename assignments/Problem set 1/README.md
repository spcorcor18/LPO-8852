# Problem set 1

**Instructions**: Answer the following questions in a Stata do-file, and submit your resulting log file via email to *sean.corcoran@vanderbilt.edu*, preferably as a PDF. Use your last name and problem set number as the filename (e.g., *Smith PS1.pdf*). The resulting log should include the questions below (commented), your commands, output, and written responses/interpretations. Graphical output (where applicable) can be submitted separately, or combined with your log into one PDF file. Working together is encouraged, but all submitted work should be that of the individual student.
