## Topics covered:

* Natural experiments
* 2x2 difference-in-differences and potential outcomes
* The parallel trends assumption
* Event study regression/graph
* Placebo/falsification tests
* Triple difference models
* Difference-in-differences with variable timing (aka "generalized difference-in-differences")
* Group-specific time trends
