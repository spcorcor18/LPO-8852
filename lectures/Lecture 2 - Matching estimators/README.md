# Lecture 3: Matching estimators (I)

## Topics covered:

* Review of concepts: potential outcomes and treatment effects, ATE vs. ATT, selection bias
* Subclassification as a method of estimating treatment effects: grouping treated and untreated observations into strata, calculating differences within strata, and taking a weighted average across strata.
* The conditional independence assumption (CIA) and methods relying on selection on observables.
* The role of common support
* Matching methods: exact matching, approximate matching (e.g., nearest neighbor)
* The propensity score: use in weighting and matching

[Gary King lecture on matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvMyjDi4dyg) - great lecture on matching methods and their connection to RCTs and blocked randomization. Covers nearest neighbors, coarsened exact matching, and propensity score matching. Also gives an overview of the problems of using propensity scores for matching.
