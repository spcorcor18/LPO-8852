## Other resources:

* About the `synth2` pacakage in Stata: see Yan, G., & Chen, Q. (2023). synth2: Synthetic control method with placebo tests, robustness test, and visualization. *The Stata Journal*, 23(3), 597-624. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1536867X231195278
* About the `synth_runner` package in Stata. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1536867X1801700404
* About the `allsynth` package in Stata: added functionality to `synth` command. https://www.stata.com/meeting/us21/slides/US21_Wiltshire.pdf
* Github repository for `augsynth` Stata package. https://github.com/ebenmichael/augsynth/tree/master
* NOTE for Mac users: the `synth` command (used by all of the above packages) does not currently (11/2023) work on MacBooks with silicon chips. The Statalist pilot recommends using the Rosetta emulator as a workaround, which appears to work.
