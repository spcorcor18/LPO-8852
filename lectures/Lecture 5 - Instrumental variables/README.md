# Lecture 9: Instrumental variables

## Topics covered:

* Method of moments estimation of OLS slope
* Method of moments motivation for IV
* Two key assumptions of a valid instrumental variable (relevance, and exclusion restriction)
* Application of IV to a charter school lottery (a "broken experiment")
* Structural equations, reduced forms, and first stage
* IV as a LATE estimator: compliers, always-takers, never-takers, and defiers
* Monotonicity assumption (no defiers)
* Statistical properties of IV estimator: consistency, bias in finite samples, less efficient than OLS
* Weak instruments problem
* Two stage least squares (2SLS): combining multiple instrumental variables efficiently, and using covariates
* 2SLS with multiple endogenous explanatory variables
* Just identified, under-identified, and over-identified models
* Over-identification tests
* Applications of IV
